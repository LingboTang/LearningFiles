PDB Processing Files
====================

**This package would require numpy package**

1. **parallel_exec.py:**
   
   * This file contains a list of all command lines to execute **batch_exec.py** and a tuple of all separate output directory.
   
   * Each command line will be executed in different thread, they share one input reading file, but they will write output files in different directory, so multi-threading in this file is thread safe. If you want to change the number of threads that you are using in this file. Go to the line which contains `pool =  ThreadPool(num_of_thread)` to change thee value of `num_of_thread`. Dynamic threading is a different story, but this simple static threading is enough to boost up the performance.
   
   * The output directory will be in the format of "out_strand_rotate_<strand_number>_move_<strand_number>/"
   
   * The batch_exec.py can take plenty of options in command line as input, which gives you the flexibility to vary and alternate your parameters
   
   Now I will explain what you can change in this file to make your automation work robustly:
   
    * The `-s` or `--angleStep` is used for controlling the step size change of rotating angle, make sure the input unit is "degrees", but it will be convert to "radians" when doing calculation, so you don't need to worry about the unit change.
    
    * The "-t" or `--transStep` is used for controlling the step size change of the parallel moving for each strand, make sure the input is A.
    
    * The `-r` or `--rotatable` is used for determining if the molecule is rotatable or not. 
      
        * `0`: disabled
        
        * `1`: enabled
    
    * The `-m` or `--movable` is used for determining if the molecule strand is movable along its strand axis or not.
    
        * `0`: disabled
        
        * `1`: enabled
    
    * The `-a` or `--strand` is used for determining which strand is going to be processed.
    
        * `0`: process the first strand
        
        * `1`: process the second strand
        
        * `2`: process both strand
        
    * It will delete and re-generate the legacy output directories at the start of the file for avoiding disk space overflow.
        
    **This script will force you to use the default options when you passed in invalid input.**
    
    **Usage Command Line Example:**
    
    `python batch_exec.py -s 2 -t 1 -r 1 -m 0 -a 0`, note that you might want to change `python` to `python3` or `python2` depends on your OS settings.
   
2. **batch_exec.py:**

    This script will execute the main part of this package `myParsePDB.py`. It will take the input from `parallel_exec.py` and then it will pass the options to execute `myParsePDB.py` depends on the options passed in by `parallel_exec.py`. The output files are generated under each separated output directory. Because the generating process is running in loops (lower_bound, upper_bound, stepsize), each output file will contain the info only for that step. So the output file has a format: `<input_file_name>_OUT_Rotate_Angle_<angle>_strand_<strand>.pdb` or `<input_file_name>_OUT_Move_Trans_<translation>_strand_<strand>.pdb`.
    
    Now, I'll explain how to set the options:
    
    * The `-i` or `--ifile` will take the input file
    
    * The `-o` or `--ofile` will specify which output file it will write to.
    
    * The `-a` or `--axis` will specify which strand you want to process
    
      * `0`: first strand
      
      * `1`: second strand
      
      * `2`: both strand
      
      * `3`: None
    
    * The `-s` or `--step` will specify the exact step value to rotate (not step size), note this `-s` is distinct from the `-s` above.
    
    * The `-m` or `--movestrand` will specify if the ability to move the strand, so it is the same as `-m` in the section `parallel_exec.py`
    
      * `0`: disabled
      
      * `1`: enabled
      
    * The `-t` or `--translation` will specify the exact step value to translate along strand axis (notrstep size), note this `-t` is distinct from the `-t` above.
    
    **Usage Command Line Example:**
    
    `python myParsePDB.py -i BP1.pdb -o <out_file> -a 3 -s 2 -m 1 -t 1`
    
3. **myParsePDB.py**

  * This code is commented in four blocks: `util functions`, `Parsing`, `Getting` and `Setting`.
  
  * Here are the list of some major util functions:
  
    * `rotation_matrix(axis, theta)`: takes arbitrary axis and rotating theta and returns a matrix that rotate objects counter-clockwise
    
    * `vector_move(point, dire, dis)`: takes a original data point, moving direction vector, moving distance scalar as parameters and returns a new data point.
    
    * `rotating_around_strand_axis(strand_op, static_axis, theta, out_coords, in_coords)`: takes strand options, rotating axis (Now I set it to the central axis between two strands), rotating theta, output coordinates and input coordinates as parameters and returns a new output coordinates.
    
    * `ceiling_to_three_digs(line, new_data)`: Finalize all data lines, and ceiling the coordinates to 3 decimal places
    
    * `output_files_in_format(outlines,outfile)`: Align and adjust data lines returned from `ceiling_to_three_digs(line, new_data)` in *.pdb format.
